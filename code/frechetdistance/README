Frechet.java is a command line version of finding Frechet Median.
To compile:
Run: $ javac Frechet.java
To run:
Run: $ java Frechet inputfile outputfile

The inputfile are a list of all input curves. The format is:
the first line is the number of way point
then all way points begins with 0
the next two lines are the starting and ending points
Then the rest lines are list of all curves
For each curve, it starts with the number of vertices, then one vertex per line.

The outputfile are the median curve. The format is:
for each curve, it starts with the number of vertices, then one vertex per line.
it do not need to claim the number of curves, even if there are more than one.
