Week of 01/23/13 - 01/29/13:
- Looked into potential server alternatives (if we will be storing information for other
versions of the game on our database, we'll need something faster and with more space)
	* Amazon EC2 information at http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/

- A way to let players initialize ant starting points
	* "Count the ants": let the players click on all of the ants (possibly within a 
	time limit, to make it more game-like). With brand-new videos, the player would 
	obviously have to play this type of mini-game first before doing any path tracing. 
	The danger of this comes if we just received a new video where no ants have been 
	initialized and the player clicks in totally wrong locations. Also, if ants start 
	on top of each other, then even after many players selecting starting points, it 
	may be difficult to determine the average point within the points that determine a 
	single ant. We would need to take the average of groups of points that are very 
	close to each other to determine where the ant's starting location is. If 
	possible, it would be helpful to know how many ants appear in the video so that we 
	can do some very primitive error checking that all ants were initialized.

Week of 01/30/13 - 02/05/13
- Reviewed some of the provided videos of ant behavior

- A (very, very basic) way to check for various ant activities
	* If the click is roughly in the same area for some number of frames (~5?), ask 
	the player to select an activity that ant may be engaged in (e.g. feeding, 
	grooming, etc.) . This may be asked in some sort of pop-up window with the options 
	listed (like in Paul's old version of the game). In the future, we may want to see 
	if we can determine ways to ask a player more specifically (based on what we can 
	see from the videos about these activities), but this seems more like a computer 
	vision problem. Ideally, there should be some way to identify patterns. And of
	course, there needs to be some tutorial (could just put video provided by biologists
	up) so that players can identify different activities.

	* After they choose an option, we can ask additional questions. For example, if 
	the player selected "Grooming," then we'd need to ask where the other ant being 
	groomed (or doing the grooming) is located. This may take away the need for some 
	drag-to-head version of the game since we could just ask players to click on the 
	ant that this current ant is interacting with.

- To initialize ants in a specific order
	* When "Count the ants" isn't enough (it should be sufficient for non-colored ant 
	colonies, but not for colored ants with existing data), display a simple drawing 
	with the appropriate color spots (as illustrated by the biologists) instead of 
	just asking by name. The drawing would be just a top-down view of an ant with four 
	spots that can be changed to any of the six colors. The problem with names is just 
	that players may have trouble remembering how the order that those colors are
	specified in corresponds to the different parts of the ant, so a simple 
	illustration would be more helpful.

- Verification and Points
	* On a side note, since the verification is now in-game, it should be possible to 
	offer some sort of points system based on that average Euclidean distance. It could 
	be something as simple as subtracting that distance from some greater constant. What 
	I mean is, just say that the reported distance was something like 7, then we could 
	give the player a score of 100 - 7 = 93 points. This is not urgent, but may be
	worth considering in future versions of the game since we had previously hoped to
	implement some sort of system.

- TODO: 
	* Continue looking into AS3
	* Watch ant documentary

Week of 02/06/13 - 02/12/13
- Watched ant documentary

- Reviewed old php code

- TODO:
	* Implement version of the game that asks players to initiate ant starting points 
	and colors
		> For the first couple of times a video is used, we need to ask players to
		list out all of the color combinations for ants. After this has been done
		a few times, we no longer need to ask players to type in colors. At this
		point, we'll trust that players have answered appropriately, and we'll
		only have players find each ant with the specified color combination.

		> So, the first part, "counting the ants" means that players have to type
		in the color combination for that ant. And then, the next part is the actual
		ant initialization where players have to click on the ant that matches
		the color description. We could split this up into two different game modes
		where you have to list out all of the colors before you unlock the actual
		initialization mode.
