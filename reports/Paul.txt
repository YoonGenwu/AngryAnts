	- Researched dynamic web pages using PHP, we can give each separate group a URL like
		http://cgi.cs.arizona.edu/projects/angryants/game.php?group=1
	then store their group id in either a PHP session or a cookie and reference the id in other PHP
	scripts so that for example, the game only fetches videos belonging to that group from the database
