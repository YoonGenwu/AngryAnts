messy notes by Livio:

make the game portable
allow different videos to be tracked for different groups of people
	basically so that people can track videos from the school they want to support.
ask people to trace the starting points of ants

modular pieces:
	different game modes
	different validation algorithms
	different videos

how to pass files? use cgi script?
use one central database rather than multiple databases
experiment with data gathered
experiment with validation

need documentation to help newcomers to the project learn what's going on
