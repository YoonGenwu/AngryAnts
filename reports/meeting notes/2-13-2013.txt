Ant notes:
Livio's idea:   
	introduction Video to try to provide Educaitional experience
	Use interest in reasearch to get people to be more interested
	Tracking all ants at the same time.
	Provide 1-3 hours of gameplay
Response:	
	Do not want to lose audience who want to lose long time investment
	Possible that some ask friends/people to do it not as a game, but as a service
	Even an hour may be too long, in that case
Another approach:
	Use juiciness (excessive interface feedback) to make the game more interesting?	
	Similar to solitare/bejeweled/popcap games
	Mindless activity
Compromise:
	Try out these and the other prototypes- try out both "stupid version and smart version"
	Want to get the system working in the meantime, and possibly soon so the game can be a service.
	Try to get to the stage where you can develop a new level of the game.
Others:
	Need to figure out how to accurately measure how long they are on the page, either using refresh or flash.
Goals:
	Continue thinking about big-picture designs, but think about the current design a lot too. Don't try to take a big risk.
	Continue making plans, but keep developing the current one, which isn't bad on its own.
	Want to develop for Ipad, either needs to use HTML5 or native code (But is a there a Youtube API?).
	By next week, try to look at Ipad and investigate on Juiciness.
