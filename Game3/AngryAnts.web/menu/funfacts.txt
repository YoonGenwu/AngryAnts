This species of ants is called temnothorax rugatulus.

These ants are also known as "rock ants."

Rock ants are mostly from the western United States.

These ants are much smaller than they appear. They are actually only 3 millimeters long.

They're so small that a similar species likes to build its colonies inside acorns.

These ants, however, prefer to live inside rock crevices or underneath rocks.

Some ants in this video may appear to be dead, but they are actually alive.

If an ant dies, it will be immediately removed from the nest.

The ants that appear dead are known as lazy ants.

It is unclear why some ants are lazy while others are not.

Almost all of the ants in the colony are worker ants.

All workers are female ants, but they do not reproduce.

Only the queen of the colony will create new offspring.

Sometimes a colony might contain more than one queen at a time.

These ants have been painted with different colors to help researchers keep track of each individual.

The area shown in this video is inside the colony's nest.

Many ants will spend their entire lives without ever leaving the nest.

If a worker ant becomes sick, it will begin to pursue riskier jobs, such as finding food outside of the nest.

The ants' antennae are like both a nose and a finger.

They use their antennae to smell, taste, and touch the world around them.

Ants communicate by using their antennae to taste the glands on their skin.

The glands on their skin contains messages and information about the state of the colony.

These messages get passed along when ants taste and touch each other.

Ants will also leave their scent behind at certain locations to guide other ants.
